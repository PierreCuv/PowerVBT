# ⚡ PowerVBT

> Velocity Based Training device — open-source IoT system for powerlifting athletes.

A compact, magnet-mounted IoT device that measures barbell velocity in real time and streams training metrics to a smartphone app via Bluetooth.

Built by athletes, for athletes.

---

## 🎯 Concept

PowerVBT is a small electronic unit fixed magnetically to a barbell (squat / bench / deadlift). It captures bar acceleration using a 6-axis IMU, computes velocity metrics on-device, and streams them live to a companion mobile app (iOS & Android).

The goal: give any powerlifter access to **Velocity Based Training** without expensive commercial equipment.

```
IMU raw data @ 200Hz
        │
        ▼
Static calibration (zero-g offset removal)
        │
        ▼
Madgwick filter (real-time orientation from accel + gyro)
        │
        ▼
Gravity vector subtraction (world frame rotation)
        │
        ▼
Low-pass filter (Butterworth 2nd order, fc = 15Hz)
        │
        ▼
ZUPT — Zero Velocity Update (drift reset at rest periods)
        │
        ▼
Trapezoidal integration → velocity (m/s)
        │
        ▼
Rep detection (velocity threshold crossing)
        │
        ▼
Metrics computation (peak vel, mean vel, TUT, tempo)
        │
        ▼
BLE GATT stream → mobile app

## 🌿 Branch Strategy

| Branch | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `main` | Stable, tested releases only |
| `dev` | Integration branch — all features merged here first |
| `feature/xxx` | Individual feature development (branch off `dev`) |
| `firmware/xxx` | Firmware-specific feature branches |
| `app/xxx` | App-specific feature branches |
| `fix/xxx` | Bug fixes |

**Workflow:**
```
feature/xxx  ──▶  dev  ──▶ (tested + validated) ──▶  main
```

Never push directly to `main`. Always go through `dev` first.

## 📐 VBT Reference — Velocity Zones

| Velocity (m/s) | Training Zone |
|----------------|--------------|
| > 1.0 | Speed / Power |
| 0.75 – 1.0 | Speed-Strength |
| 0.50 – 0.75 | Strength-Speed |
| 0.35 – 0.50 | Strength |
| < 0.35 | Maximal Strength / Grind |

*Based on Bryan Mann's VBT velocity zones.*
